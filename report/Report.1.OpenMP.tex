\section{"Convert" sequential to parallel }
In method labwork1\_OpenMP(), the code is almost the same as in labwork1\_CPU().\\
The different is that it has a OpenMP directive as below
\begin{verbatim}
#pragma omp parallel for
\end{verbatim}

By using parallel computing, the program's duration is reduce to only a quater of sequential computing.\\
The detail of the configurations and their output are as below
