\section{Hello, CUDA}
First, I create the global kernel "grayscale". It is global since it runs on device and it can be called from host.\\
Then I do the four classical steps:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Load data from host to device (Allocate memory on device, Copy memory from host to device)
  \item Ask device to process data (Call kernel)
  \item Device runs in parallel
  \item Device returns result (Copy memory from device to host, Free memory)
\end{itemize}
It took about 70ms to finish. Comparing to CPU processing, it is 10 times faster.
