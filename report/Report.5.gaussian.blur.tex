\section{Gaussian Blur Convolution}
To do the Gaussian Blur, each new pixel is calculated as the weighted average of surrounding pixels.\\
With shared memory, each thread of the first 49 threads copy one element of weights array to the shared memory.\\
The result goes as below.
\begin{verbatim}
Labwork 5 CPU ellapsed 1665.8ms
Labwork 5 GPU with shared memory ellapsed 27.4ms
Labwork 5 GPU without shared memory ellapsed 37.9ms
GPU with shared memory is faster than GPU without shared memory by: 1.38 times
GPU with shared memory is faster than CPU by: 60.72 times
\end{verbatim}
